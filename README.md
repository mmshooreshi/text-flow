# Each bundle
Each bundle is made up of different blocks, and each block contains a series of learning chunks. These blocks interact with one another to form learning bundles. People can modify these bundles by adding point dots and getting approval from more experiencedÂ users in the field. The reward algorithm encourages them to help one another.
